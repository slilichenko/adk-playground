# ADK Playground

This project is to show ADK best practices, design patterns and various tips and tricks. 

The code samples in this repo were built and tested using ADK's Python SDK and Google's Gemini models.  But all the best practices and design
patterns should be applicable to other SDKs and [models supported by ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/models/#model-choice). 

[ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) is pretty extensive and constantly
improving. If you find any discrepancies between this repo and the official documentation - assume
that the documentation is correct (or read the source code or run your own tests).

> **🧪 Note:** We attempt to keep the code snippets up-to-date, but we work on
> this project the best effort basis. If you find issues - we would appreciate if you report them!

This project has two sections: [Design Patterns](patterns/README.md)
and [Best Practices](best-practices/README.md).
